# Story 2.2: Framework Ranking

**ID:** S2.2
**Epic:** E02 - Core Decision Analysis
**User Story:** As a user, I want the Orchestrator agent to analyze my query and rank all 10 available frameworks based on relevance, providing a score and rationale for each.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. After submitting a query, the Orchestrator agent must process the text.
2. The agent must return a ranked list of all 10 frameworks.
3. Each framework in the list must have a relevance score and a brief, human-readable rationale explaining why it is or isn't a good fit.

* The ranking and rationale will be generated by the Multi-Criteria Scoring Algorithm.
* The ranked list will be stored in the `ranked_frameworks` field of the session document in Firestore, as detailed in story S5.3.
