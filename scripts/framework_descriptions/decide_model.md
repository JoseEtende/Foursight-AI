# DECIDE Decision Model

## Definition and Description
The DECIDE Decision Model is a structured, step-by-step framework designed to guide systematic decision-making in complex situations. The acronym DECIDE stands for Define, Explore, Consider, Identify, Decide, and Evaluate, representing the six sequential phases of the decision process. This framework emphasizes thorough problem definition, comprehensive alternative exploration, and systematic evaluation of options before implementation.

## Reasoning Methodology
1. **Define**: Clearly articulate the problem or decision to be made
2. **Explore**: Research and gather all relevant information
3. **Consider**: Generate potential alternatives
4. **Identify**: Evaluate alternatives against criteria
5. **Decide**: Select the optimal alternative
6. **Evaluate**: Monitor implementation and results

## AI Integration Protocol
- **Define Phase**: AI assists in problem framing and objective clarification
- **Explore Phase**: AI conducts comprehensive information gathering
- **Consider Phase**: AI enhances alternative generation
- **Identify Phase**: AI performs systematic evaluation
- **Decide Phase**: AI provides decision support
- **Evaluate Phase**: AI enables outcome monitoring

## Application Scenarios
- **Strategic Business Decisions**: Market entry, product launches, or acquisitions
- **Project Selection**: Choosing between competing initiatives with limited resources
- **Policy Development**: Creating organizational policies or regulations
- **Technology Implementation**: Selecting and deploying new systems or platforms
- **Resource Allocation**: Distributing limited resources across competing needs
- **Crisis Management**: Responding to unexpected challenges or emergencies
- **Career Decisions**: Evaluating job offers or career path options
- **Healthcare Decisions**: Treatment selection for complex medical conditions

## User Proficiency Requirements
- **Intermediate Level**: Requires moderate analytical skills and systematic thinking
- **Research Skills**: Ability to gather and evaluate relevant information
- **Analytical Thinking**: Capacity to break down complex problems
- **Objectivity**: Ability to evaluate options without undue bias
- **Documentation Discipline**: Commitment to recording process and rationale
- **Implementation Focus**: Skill in translating decisions into action plans
- **Evaluation Mindset**: Willingness to assess outcomes and learn from results

## Framework Limitations
- **Time Intensity**: Full process requires significant time investment
- **Information Dependence**: Quality heavily influenced by available data
- **Complexity Management**: May become unwieldy for highly complex decisions
- **Emotional Factors**: Limited explicit consideration of emotional aspects
- **Group Dynamics**: Additional facilitation needed for group decision-making
- **Expertise Requirements**: Effective criteria development requires domain knowledge
- **Implementation Gap**: Thorough analysis doesn't guarantee effective execution
