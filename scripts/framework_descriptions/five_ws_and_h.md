# 5Ws and H Framework (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How)

## Definition and Description
The 5Ws and H Framework is a comprehensive questioning methodology that ensures thorough exploration of a decision context by addressing six fundamental questions: Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How. This systematic approach helps gather complete information, clarify objectives, and consider implementation details before making decisions.

## Reasoning Methodology
1. **Who**: Identify all stakeholders involved in or affected by the decision
2. **What**: Define precisely what needs to be decided and what actions will follow
3. **When**: Determine timing considerations, deadlines, and temporal constraints
4. **Where**: Establish location, jurisdiction, or contextual boundaries
5. **Why**: Articulate the purpose, goals, and underlying rationale
6. **How**: Explore methods, resources, and practical implementation approaches
7. **Integration**: Synthesize insights from all questions to form a comprehensive understanding
8. **Decision Formulation**: Develop decision options informed by the complete context

## AI Integration Protocol
- **Contextual Analysis**: Natural language processing to extract relevant entities and relationships
- **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Build interconnected representation of all 5W+H elements
- **Gap Detection**: Identify missing information across the question categories
- **Automated Questioning**: Generate follow-up queries to complete the information landscape
- **Cross-Validation**: Verify consistency across different question domains
- **Insight Generation**: Produce synthesized understanding based on complete information set
- **Visualization**: Create multi-dimensional representations of the decision context

## Application Scenarios
- **Project Planning**: Comprehensive scoping of new initiatives
- **Problem Diagnosis**: Structured approach to understanding complex issues
- **Strategic Decision-Making**: Ensuring all aspects are considered before committing
- **Communication Planning**: Developing complete messaging strategies
- **Process Design**: Creating workflows with full contextual awareness
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifying potential issues across multiple dimensions
- **Change Management**: Understanding all facets of organizational changes

## User Proficiency Requirements
- **Moderate Analytical Skills**: Ability to explore questions systematically
- **Contextual Thinking**: Capacity to see connections between different question domains
- **Communication Skills**: Ability to articulate clear questions and synthesize responses
- **Basic Organizational Ability**: Skill to structure information across categories
- **Suitable for**: Mid-level professionals, analysts, project managers

## Limitations and Boundary Conditions
- **Information Availability**: Effectiveness limited by accessible information
- **Question Quality**: Results depend on how well questions are formulated
- **Analysis Paralysis**: Risk of excessive information gathering without decision progress
- **Subjective Elements**: "Why" questions particularly vulnerable to bias
- **Complexity Management**: May become unwieldy for highly complex decisions
- **Depth vs. Breadth**: Balancing comprehensive coverage against focused analysis

## Inputs and Outputs
**Inputs:**
- Decision context and objectives
- Available information related to each question category
- Stakeholder perspectives and requirements
- Resource constraints and opportunities
- Organizational or personal goals

**Outputs:**
- Comprehensive contextual map of the decision landscape
- Identified information gaps requiring further investigation
- Structured documentation of all relevant decision factors
- Clear articulation of purpose and implementation approach
- Decision options informed by complete contextual understanding
