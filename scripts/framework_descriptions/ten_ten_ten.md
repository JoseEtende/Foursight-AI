# 10-10-10 Rule (Temporal Impact Assessment)

## Definition and Description
The 10-10-10 Rule is a temporal decision-making framework developed by Suzy Welch that evaluates choices based on their consequences across three different time horizons: 10 minutes, 10 months, and 10 years. This approach helps decision-makers balance immediate emotional reactions with medium and long-term implications, providing perspective that can prevent short-sighted decisions and reduce decision regret.

## Reasoning Methodology
1. **Identify the Decision**: Clearly articulate the decision to be made and the available options
2. **10 Minutes Assessment**: For each option, consider:
   - What will be the immediate consequences?
   - How will I feel right after making this choice?
   - What immediate reactions will I face from others?
   - What immediate benefits or challenges will arise?
3. **10 Months Assessment**: For each option, consider:
   - How will this decision affect my life in the medium term?
   - What ongoing consequences will I experience?
   - How will my situation have changed as a result?
   - What opportunities or limitations might emerge?
4. **10 Years Assessment**: For each option, consider:
   - How will this decision shape my long-term future?
   - Will this choice align with my core values and life goals?
   - What lasting impact will this have on my relationships and career?
   - How might I reflect on this decision a decade from now?
5. **Holistic Evaluation**: Integrate insights from all three time horizons
6. **Decision Selection**: Choose the option that offers the best balance across time frames

## AI Integration Protocol
- **Temporal Projection**: AI models future scenarios across different time horizons
- **Emotional Impact Prediction**: AI estimates emotional responses at each time point
- **Value Alignment Check**: AI evaluates options against user's stated values and goals
- **Consequence Mapping**: AI generates comprehensive consequence trees for each option
- **Bias Detection**: AI identifies when user is overweighting short-term considerations
- **Perspective Shifting**: AI presents alternative viewpoints from future time frames
- **Documentation**: AI creates structured records of temporal assessments for future reference

## Application Scenarios
- **Career Decisions**: Job changes, career pivots, or educational investments
- **Relationship Choices**: Commitment decisions, conflict resolution, or boundary setting
- **Financial Planning**: Major purchases, investments, or debt management
- **Health Decisions**: Lifestyle changes, treatment options, or preventive measures
- **Habit Formation**: Establishing routines with short-term costs but long-term benefits
- **Ethical Dilemmas**: Balancing immediate pressures against enduring principles
- **Life Transitions**: Relocations, family planning, or retirement decisions

## User Proficiency Requirements
- **Basic Level**: Accessible to most users with minimal training
- **Temporal Perspective**: Ability to mentally project into different time horizons
- **Emotional Awareness**: Recognition of how emotions influence immediate judgments
- **Self-Knowledge**: Understanding of personal values and long-term aspirations
- **Consequence Thinking**: Capacity to trace potential outcomes of decisions
- **Balanced Consideration**: Willingness to weigh all three time frames without bias

## Framework Limitations
- **Future Uncertainty**: Long-term projections become increasingly speculative
- **Changing Values**: Personal values and priorities may shift over time
- **Emotional Variability**: Emotional forecasting is often inaccurate
- **Complexity Handling**: May oversimplify highly complex decisions
- **External Factors**: Cannot account for all possible external changes
- **Time Horizon Arbitrariness**: The specific "10" intervals may not be optimal for all decisions
- **Quantification Challenges**: Difficult to assign numerical values to qualitative impacts

## Inputs and Outputs
**Inputs:**
- Clear decision statement
- Available options or alternatives
- Personal values and priorities

- Relevant contextual information

**Outputs:**
- Immediate impact assessment for each option
- Medium-term consequence projection
- Long-term implication analysis
- Temporal balance evaluation
- Decision recommendation with temporal justification
- Anticipated emotional responses across time horizons
- Implementation considerations based on temporal insights
