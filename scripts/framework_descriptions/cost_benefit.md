# Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) Framework

## Definition and Description
Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) is a systematic approach to decision-making that quantifies and compares the total costs against the total benefits of different options. This framework translates diverse impacts into monetary values, enabling direct comparison through metrics such as net present value (NPV), benefit-cost ratio (BCR), or return on investment (ROI). CBA provides a rigorous economic foundation for evaluating alternatives based on their overall value creation.

## Reasoning Methodology
1. **Scope Definition**: Establish the boundaries and timeframe for analysis
2. **Stakeholder Identification**: Determine whose costs and benefits will be considered
3. **Alternative Specification**: Define the options to be evaluated
4. **Cost Identification**: Enumerate all direct and indirect costs for each alternative
5. **Benefit Identification**: Enumerate all direct and indirect benefits
6. **Monetization**: Convert all costs and benefits to monetary values
7. **Time Adjustment**: Apply discounting to account for the time value of money
8. **Calculation**: Compute key metrics (NPV, BCR, ROI, payback period)
9. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Test how results change with different assumptions
10. **Decision Selection**: Choose the option with the most favorable economic outcome

## AI Integration Protocol
- **Data Collection**: Gather historical cost and benefit data from multiple sources
- **Predictive Modeling**: Apply machine learning to forecast future costs and benefits
- **Automated Monetization**: Implement algorithms to convert non-monetary impacts to financial values
- **Discount Rate Optimization**: Use economic models to determine appropriate discount rates
- **Uncertainty Modeling**: Apply Monte Carlo simulation for probabilistic CBA
- **Visualization**: Generate interactive dashboards showing cost-benefit distributions
- **Recommendation Engine**: Provide decision recommendations with confidence intervals
- **Monitoring System**: Track actual costs and benefits against projections

## Application Scenarios
- **Capital Investment Decisions**: Evaluating major expenditures and infrastructure projects
- **Policy Analysis**: Assessing the economic impact of regulations and public policies
- **Program Evaluation**: Determining the value of social programs and interventions
- **Technology Adoption**: Evaluating new systems and technological implementations
- **Process Improvement**: Assessing the value of operational changes
- **Resource Allocation**: Optimizing distribution of limited resources across initiatives
- **Product Development**: Evaluating potential return on new product investments
- **Environmental Decision-Making**: Assessing projects with significant ecological impacts

## User Proficiency Requirements
- **Financial Literacy**: Understanding of basic economic and financial concepts
- **Quantitative Skills**: Ability to work with numerical data and calculations
- **Analytical Thinking**: Capacity to identify and categorize diverse impacts
- **Economic Perspective**: Understanding of concepts like opportunity cost and time value of money
- **Suitable for**: Financial analysts, economists, project managers, policy analysts, business strategists

## Limitations and Boundary Conditions
- **Monetization Challenges**: Difficulty in assigning monetary values to intangible impacts
- **Discount Rate Sensitivity**: Results highly dependent on chosen discount rate
- **Distributional Blindness**: May obscure who bears costs versus who receives benefits
- **Time Horizon Uncertainty**: Challenges in forecasting distant costs and benefits
- **Quantification Bias**: Tendency to overemphasize easily quantified factors
- **Ethical Considerations**: Some impacts resist legitimate monetary valuation
- **Data Requirements**: Extensive information needed for comprehensive analysis
- **Expertise Demands**: Proper implementation requires specialized knowledge
