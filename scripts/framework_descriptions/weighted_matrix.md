# Weighted Decision Matrix

## Definition and Description
A Weighted Decision Matrix is a quantitative decision-making tool that evaluates a set of alternatives against a list of criteria, with each criterion assigned a weight based on its importance. This framework provides a structured and systematic way to compare multiple, dissimilar options, making it particularly useful for complex decisions where various factors must be balanced.

## Reasoning Methodology
1. **Identify Alternatives**: List all potential options to be evaluated.
2. **Determine Criteria**: Identify all relevant criteria for the decision.
3. **Assign Weights**: Assign a numerical weight to each criterion based on its relative importance.
4. **Score Alternatives**: Score each alternative against each criterion.
5. **Calculate Weighted Scores**: Multiply each score by the weight of the criterion.
6. **Sum Scores**: Sum the weighted scores for each alternative to get a total score.
7. **Select Best Option**: The alternative with the highest total score is the recommended choice.

## AI Integration Protocol
- **Criteria Suggestion**: AI can suggest relevant criteria based on the decision context.
- **Weighting Assistance**: AI can help calibrate weights by analyzing historical data or stated priorities.
- **Automated Scoring**: AI can score alternatives based on provided data.
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: AI can automatically perform sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of the decision.

## Application Scenarios
- **Vendor Selection**: Choosing between different suppliers or service providers.
- **Technology Selection**: Selecting a new software, hardware, or platform.
- **Hiring Decisions**: Comparing multiple candidates for a job.
- **Project Prioritization**: Deciding which projects to invest in.

## User Proficiency Requirements
- **Intermediate**: Requires analytical thinking and comfort with numbers.
- **Objectivity**: Ability to score options consistently and without bias.

## Limitations and Boundary Conditions
- **Subjectivity in Weighting**: The weights assigned to criteria are subjective.
- **Garbage In, Garbage Out**: The quality of the decision depends on the quality of the criteria and scores.
- **Oversimplification**: Can oversimplify complex decisions by reducing them to a single number.

## Inputs and Outputs
**Inputs:**
- A list of alternatives.
- A list of decision criteria.
- Weights for each criterion.
- Scores for each alternative against each criterion.

**Outputs:**
- A ranked list of alternatives.
- A clear, documented rationale for the decision.
